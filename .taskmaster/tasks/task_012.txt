# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Uno Game Engine Core Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core Uno game engine for tracking live physical Uno games with digital state management, rule validation, and real-time assistance
# Details:
Create Uno card definitions with colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) and types (Number 0-9, Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, Wild Draw Four) that can be mapped to physical cards. Implement game initialization with virtual deck tracking that mirrors physical deck state. Build turn management system with player rotation and special card effects for physical game assistance. Create card validation logic for legal moves and game rule enforcement that works with card input from physical gameplay. Implement card input mechanisms supporting QR codes, manual entry, and card scanning. Build game state synchronization between physical cards and digital tracking. Add player hand tracking that maintains privacy while providing rule assistance. Implement win condition detection and scoring system for physical game completion. Add game state serialization for database storage and real-time synchronization across devices.

# Test Strategy:
Test card input mechanisms (QR scanning, manual entry), physical-digital state synchronization, turn progression with physical cards, special card effects validation, move validation for physical plays, player hand privacy, win condition detection, and real-time game assistance accuracy
