# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define TypeScript Interfaces and Mock Data
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create TypeScript interfaces for Event and Guest entities and generate mock data
# Details:
Create /src/types/index.ts with interfaces: `Event { id: string, title: string, date: string, guestList: Guest[] }` and `Guest { id: string, name: string, checkedIn: boolean }`. Create /src/data/mockData.ts with 2+ events (Meetup, Sucia Read) containing 10-20 guests each. Ensure guest names are diverse and alphabetically sortable. Include realistic event dates and titles.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to validate mock data structure matches TypeScript interfaces. Test that guest lists contain 10-20 entries and are properly typed.
