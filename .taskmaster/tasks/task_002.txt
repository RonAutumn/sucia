# Task ID: 2
# Title: Install and Configure Core Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Install and configure essential libraries for the Next.js-based control hub platform, focusing on state management, server state, real-time functionality, and support for games and queue management features.
# Details:
Since TailwindCSS is already configured and Next.js uses file-based routing, React Router is not required. Install Zustand@^4.4.0 for client-side state management and @tanstack/react-query@^5.0.0 for server state management. Add the Supabase client for real-time and database functionality. Include any additional essential libraries needed for the control hub platform, as well as dependencies required for games and queue management features. Ensure all packages are compatible with Next.js architecture.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all packages install without conflicts, Zustand and React Query integrate correctly with Next.js, Supabase client connects and handles real-time updates, and all dependencies for games and queue management are functional within the Next.js environment.
