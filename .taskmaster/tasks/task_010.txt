# Title: Finalize Notification System for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Polish and verify core notification system for production, focusing on essential SMS, email, and in-app notifications only.
# Details:
Ensure notification service is stable and production-ready using Supabase Edge Functions for SMS/email delivery. Integrate with Twilio API for SMS and SendGrid for email. Implement in-app notifications using react-hot-toast with Sucia branding and dark theme support. Remove advanced queue/retry logic and focus on reliable delivery for MVP. Ensure notification preferences allow users to opt in/out. Prepare notification templates for essential events (queue updates, invites, system alerts). Test on Vercel preview and production environments.

# Test Strategy:
Test SMS/email delivery, in-app notification display, user preference toggles, and notification delivery on Vercel deployment. Verify Sucia logo and dark theme are present in notification UI.
