# Task ID: 3
# Title: Setup Supabase Integration and Authentication
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Supabase client for demo purposes with minimal authentication and real-time subscriptions for core features
# Details:
Build upon existing Supabase client setup to support demo features including games platform, services/queue management, check-in process, and real-time updates. Implement minimal authentication suitable for demonstration purposes rather than production security. Focus on database connectivity and real-time subscriptions for showcasing platform capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Test database connectivity, verify minimal authentication flow works, confirm real-time subscriptions for games and services features, and validate check-in process functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Supabase Client [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install @supabase/supabase-js@^2.38.0 and set up the Supabase client using environment variables for SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.
### Details:
Create a .env file in the project root with SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY. Access these variables in code to initialize the Supabase client.

Completed Supabase client setup:

✅ **Supabase client is already installed** (@supabase/supabase-js@^2.50.0) from Task 2
✅ **Created Supabase configuration** in `src/utils/supabase.ts` with:
  - Proper environment variable validation
  - Authentication settings (autoRefreshToken, persistSession, detectSessionInUrl)
  - Realtime configuration
  - TypeScript type exports for User and Session
✅ **Updated env.template** to include Supabase configuration variables
✅ **Verified .gitignore** properly excludes environment files for security

**Next:** The user needs to create a `.env.local` file with their actual Supabase project URL and anon key. The configuration is ready to use once environment variables are set.

## 2. Implement Minimal Demo Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create simple authentication system suitable for demo purposes, focusing on basic user identification rather than security.
### Details:
Implement lightweight authentication that allows users to identify themselves for demo purposes. This could include simple username entry, guest mode, or basic login without complex validation. Priority is on functionality demonstration rather than security.

## 6. Test Database Connectivity [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Verify Supabase database connection and basic CRUD operations for demo data.
### Details:
Test database connectivity by performing basic read/write operations. Ensure the Supabase client can successfully connect to the database and handle demo data for games, services, and check-in features.
<info added on 2025-06-13T19:37:03.035Z>
Created database connectivity testing infrastructure:

✅ **Created `src/utils/supabaseTest.ts`** with:
  - Environment configuration checker
  - Database connectivity test function
  - Realtime connection test
  - Comprehensive demo test runner

✅ **Created `src/components/SupabaseDemo.tsx`** demo component with:
  - Visual environment status display
  - Interactive connectivity testing UI
  - Instructions for Supabase setup
  - Overview of demo features (games, services, check-in)

**Ready for use:** The testing infrastructure is complete. Users can:
1. Create `.env.local` with their Supabase credentials
2. Use the SupabaseDemo component to verify connectivity
3. See real-time test results and setup instructions

**Next:** Move to real-time subscriptions setup for core demo features.

## 7. Setup Real-Time Subscriptions for Core Features [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Configure real-time subscriptions for games platform, services/queue management, and check-in process.
### Details:
Set up Supabase Realtime channels to listen for changes in tables related to games, services queue, and check-in status. Implement real-time updates to showcase live functionality in the demo.
<info added on 2025-06-13T19:38:45.088Z>
Completed real-time subscriptions setup for core demo features:

Created `src/utils/realtimeManager.ts` with:
- RealtimeManager class for managing Supabase Realtime connections
- Support for game lobbies, service queue, and check-in subscriptions
- Custom demo event broadcasting for testing
- Connection management and cleanup utilities
- TypeScript interfaces for all demo data types

Created `src/hooks/useRealtime.ts` with React hooks:
- `useRealtimeConnection()` - connection status and control
- `useRealtimeGameLobbies()` - game lobby updates with simulation
- `useRealtimeServiceQueue()` - service queue updates with simulation
- `useRealtimeCheckIns()` - check-in events with simulation
- `useRealtimeDemoEvents()` - custom demo event broadcasting

Key Features Ready:
- Games Platform: Real-time game lobby updates and player matching
- Services Queue: Live queue position and status updates
- Check-in Process: Real-time guest check-in tracking
- Demo Simulation: Built-in simulation functions for testing without database

Usage: Components can now easily integrate real-time features using the provided hooks, with fallback simulation for demo purposes.

## 8. Configure Demo Data Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 3.6
### Description: Set up basic database schema and seed data for games, services, and check-in features.
### Details:
Create or configure database tables for demo features including games platform data, services queue management, and check-in process. Add sample data to demonstrate functionality.
