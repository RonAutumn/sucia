# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement React Router and Basic App Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Setup routing for event selection, guest list view, and admin reset functionality
# Details:
Install React Router: `npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom`. Create App.tsx with BrowserRouter containing routes: '/' (EventPicker), '/event/:id' (GuestList), '/admin' (AdminReset). Create basic component shells: EventPicker.tsx, GuestList.tsx, AdminReset.tsx. Implement navigation between routes using useNavigate hook.

# Test Strategy:
Test routing functionality - verify navigation between all routes works correctly. Test URL parameters are passed properly to GuestList component. Confirm /admin route is accessible but not linked from main navigation.
