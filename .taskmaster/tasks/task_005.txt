# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Core TypeScript Types and Interfaces
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Define comprehensive TypeScript types for all data models, API responses, and component props
# Details:
Create type definitions matching database schema: User, UserProfile, GameRoom, GameSession, GameParticipant, ServiceType, ServiceQueue, ServiceSession, Notification. Define union types for game status, queue status, and user roles. Create API response types with generic error handling. Implement game state types for Uno including card types, player actions, and game phases. Set up utility types for form validation and component props with strict typing.
