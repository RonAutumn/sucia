# Description: Implement offline detection with user feedback for future-proofing
# Details:
Create custom hook useOnlineStatus using navigator.onLine and online/offline event listeners. Display offline banner when navigator.onLine === false: 'Offline; changes will sync when online'. Style banner with warning colors and sticky positioning. Hide banner when back online. Ensure check-in functionality continues to work offline using localStorage. Add network status indicator in header.

# Test Strategy:
Test offline detection by disabling network connection. Verify banner appears/disappears correctly. Test check-in functionality works offline. Validate localStorage maintains data during offline periods.
