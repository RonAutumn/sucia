# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Complete the Next.js migration by addressing remaining configuration warnings and thoroughly testing all migrated routes and components. The core migration from React Vite to Next.js has been successfully completed with all components preserved and the development server running.
# Details:
The Next.js migration has been successfully completed with Next.js 15.3.3 installed, all routes converted to file-based routing, and the development server running on http://localhost:3002. All 40+ existing React components have been preserved in src/components. The remaining work involves cleaning up deprecated configuration warnings, comprehensive testing of all migrated functionality, and ensuring production readiness.

# Test Strategy:
Systematically test all migrated routes to ensure they function correctly with preserved components. Verify API routes work properly, test dynamic routing with event IDs, confirm protected routes function as expected, and validate that all existing functionality remains intact after the migration. Test both development and production builds.
