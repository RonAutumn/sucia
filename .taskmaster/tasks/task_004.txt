# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Database Schema and Tables
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the complete database schema in Supabase with proper relationships and constraints
# Details:
Execute SQL migrations to create all required tables: users, user_profiles, game_rooms, game_sessions, game_participants, service_types, service_queues, service_sessions, and notifications. Set up foreign key relationships and constraints. Create indexes for performance on frequently queried columns (user_id, session_id, queue positions). Implement database functions for queue position management and game state updates. Set up triggers for automatic timestamp updates and notification generation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all tables created successfully, foreign key constraints work properly, indexes improve query performance, and database functions execute without errors

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Document Schema Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure of all required tables, their columns, data types, and relationships.
### Details:
Create a schema diagram and SQL file(s) for tables: users, user_profiles, game_rooms, game_sessions, game_participants, service_types, service_queues, service_sessions, and notifications. Specify primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

## 2. Implement SQL Migrations for Table Creation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Execute SQL migrations to create all tables and establish relationships.
### Details:
Run migration scripts in Supabase to create tables with defined relationships and constraints. Ensure foreign keys and constraints are properly set.

## 3. Create Indexes for Performance Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Add indexes to frequently queried columns to improve query performance.
### Details:
Create indexes on columns such as user_id, session_id, and queue positions in relevant tables.

## 4. Implement Database Functions and Triggers [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Write and deploy database functions and triggers for business logic.
### Details:
Implement functions for queue position management and game state updates. Set up triggers for automatic timestamp updates and notification generation.

## 5. Validate Schema and Test Data Integrity [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Test the complete schema with sample data and validate all constraints, relationships, and business logic.
### Details:
Insert test data into all tables, verify foreign key constraints, triggers, and functions. Ensure notifications and timestamps are generated as expected.
