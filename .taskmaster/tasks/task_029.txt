# Task ID: 29
# Title: Prepare Application for Vercel Deployment with Production Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the application for production deployment on Vercel with optimized build settings, environment variables, routing configuration, and CDN asset optimization. Most production infrastructure is now complete - focus on resolving legacy component conflicts and final deployment validation.
# Details:
Prepare the Sucia application for production deployment on Vercel with comprehensive optimizations:

**COMPLETED CONFIGURATIONS** âœ…:
- Vercel configuration (vercel.json) with proper Next.js routing, API handling, caching, and security headers
- Production-optimized next.config.js with image optimization, bundle analysis, compression, and standalone output
- Enhanced package.json with production build scripts and deployment commands
- Comprehensive PRODUCTION_ENV_SETUP.md deployment guide
- PWA-ready manifest.json with modern features and proper icons
- PerformanceMonitor.tsx component with Core Web Vitals tracking
- Production-optimized _document.tsx and _app.tsx with error boundaries and monitoring
- ErrorBoundary.tsx component with production error handling
- Automated production deployment script (scripts/deploy-production.js)

**REMAINING TASKS**:

1. **Legacy Component Cleanup** (CRITICAL):
   - Remove or convert 15+ legacy React components using react-router-dom
   - These components are incompatible with Next.js and causing build failures
   - Identify which components are actually used vs. leftover from previous implementation
   - Convert necessary components to use Next.js router patterns
   - Remove unused legacy components entirely

2. **Build Validation**:
   - Resolve react-router-dom import conflicts
   - Run successful 'npm run build' without errors
   - Test production build locally with 'npm start'
   - Validate all pages and API routes function correctly

3. **Final Deployment Testing**:
   - Test automated deployment script (scripts/deploy-production.js)
   - Deploy to Vercel preview environment for validation
   - Verify all production optimizations are working
   - Confirm environment variables and database connections

4. **Production Launch Preparation**:
   - Configure custom domain and SSL in Vercel dashboard
   - Set up production environment variables
   - Enable error tracking and performance monitoring
   - Prepare rollback procedures if needed

# Test Strategy:
1. **Legacy Component Resolution Testing**:
   - Identify all files importing from 'react-router-dom'
   - Test build after removing each legacy component
   - Verify no functionality is broken by component removal
   - Ensure all remaining routes use Next.js router patterns

2. **Production Build Validation**:
   - Run 'npm run build' to verify successful production build
   - Test 'npm start' to ensure production server starts correctly
   - Use 'npm run build:analyze' to verify bundle optimization
   - Run 'npm run type-check' to ensure TypeScript compliance

3. **Deployment Script Testing**:
   - Execute 'node scripts/deploy-production.js' for automated validation
   - Verify all pre-deployment checks pass successfully
   - Test Lighthouse performance analysis integration
   - Confirm deployment guidance and next steps are clear

4. **Vercel Preview Environment Testing**:
   - Deploy to Vercel preview environment using deployment script
   - Verify all production optimizations are active
   - Test Core Web Vitals and performance monitoring
   - Validate error boundaries and error tracking functionality
   - Confirm PWA features and manifest configuration

5. **Production Readiness Verification**:
   - Run comprehensive Lighthouse audit (target 90+ scores)
   - Test all interactive features in production environment
   - Verify database connections and API functionality
   - Test error handling and recovery procedures
   - Confirm monitoring and analytics are properly configured
