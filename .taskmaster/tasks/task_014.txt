# Task ID: 14
# Title: Polish Game User Interface for MVP
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Finalize simple, branded Ice Breaker Bingo interface with essential controls and Sucia branding.
# Details:
Retain only the basic 5x5 bingo card grid, player progress tracking, and core game controls. Remove advanced admin/game master features. Integrate Sucia logo in page headers and ensure consistent branding. Complete dark theme support across all components. Remove development artifacts and ensure a polished, production-ready UI for Vercel deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Test bingo card grid, square marking, player progress, and branding on desktop/mobile. Verify dark theme and absence of dev/test UI.
