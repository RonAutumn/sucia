      "taskTitle": "Implement Notification System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the notification system implementation into subtasks for: (1) Supabase Edge Functions setup, (2) Twilio SMS integration, (3) SendGrid email integration, (4) in-app notification UI with react-hot-toast, (5) notification preferences management, (6) notification queue and retry logic, and (7) notification template management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple third-party services (Twilio, SendGrid), building both backend and frontend components, managing user preferences, implementing delivery tracking and retry logic, and supporting multiple notification channels. Each area requires distinct expertise and careful coordination, making the overall complexity high and justifying a breakdown into at least seven focused subtasks."
